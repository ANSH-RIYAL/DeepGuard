# DeepGuard

DeepGuard is a premium deepfake detection and protection service designed for high-profile individuals and organizations. It employs advanced GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) architectures to provide robust protection against deepfake threats.

## Overview

DeepGuard uses a sophisticated approach to deepfake detection by:
1. Training high-quality GANs on premium client data
2. Training low-quality GANs on publicly available data
3. Continuously validating and improving detection capabilities
4. Providing automated legal response and takedown services

## Features

- **Advanced Detection**: State-of-the-art GAN-based detection system
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous web scraping and media analysis
- **Legal Protection**: Automated takedown notices and legal documentation
- **Privacy-First**: Personal server deployment for data security
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed analysis and documentation for legal action

## Technical Stack

- Python
- PyTorch
- FastAPI
- PostgreSQL
- Docker
- AWS/GCP
